# YouTube – Optimizing Ad Experience for Gen Z

YouTube wanted to understand what Generation Z viewers preferred when it came to brand-creator partnerships. They wanted to improve the ad-viewing experience for this upcoming generation.

We conducted big data analytics with YouTube Ads team to understand Gen Z preferences for creator-brand collaborations, resulting in changes in YouTube platform UI and increasing ad engagement by 20%.

We utilized the social media listening tool, BrandWatch, to get an idea of the general conversation happening around ads among Gen Z viewers. Then, to get specific insights, we identified and analyzed three creator-brand partnerships:
1) Highly appreciated: Bella Poarch x Moncler
2) Highly disliked: Mikayla Nougeira x Loreal
3) Mildly disliked: James Charles x Morphe

We downloaded the comments on the posts surrounding the partnerships from various platforms: twitter, youtube, instagram comments and then conducted topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Algorithm to identify themes. 

We found that Gen Z viewers highly value authenticity and transparency in the creators they follow, implying:
1) Ad-reads need to appear genuine
2) Ads cannot be overly repetitive
3) Ads need to be relevant and engaging

The success of ads for gen Z depends on the following: 
1) The values and public perception around the creator and brand
2) Residing within the domain of expertise of the influencer showcasing the product
3) Alignment with the “personal brand” of the influencer showcasing the product

The most important finding was that Gen Z wanted to have a seamless ad-viewing experience and have in-video audience engagement opportunities. We recommended UI changes based on these findings and YouTube incorporated them in their ad-displaying user interface, such as Brand info-card during in-video ad-reads and creator-curated storefronts of the brands they use in their videos.
